## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Jean-Baptiste Demonte**, a passionate full-stack developer and freelance engineer.  
I've been writing code for over 20 years — it's both my job and my hobby.

I’ve spent most of my career in startups, often from the ground up — designing systems, building teams, and shipping real products.  
Along the way, I’ve also been **CTO and co-founder**, leading tech teams, scaling products, and helping raise funding for ambitious projects.  
I love environments where I can have real impact, learn fast, and shape things from the ground up.

Today I focus on **Go**, **TypeScript**, and **React**, and I care deeply about clean code, good architecture, and developer experience.  
I'm also into **retro-gaming**, AI, and regularly follow MOOCs to keep learning.  

Whenever I can, I contribute to open source — it’s my way of giving back 🌍
