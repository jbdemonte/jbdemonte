## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Jean-Baptiste Demonte**, a passionate full-stack developer and freelance engineer.  
I've been writing code for over 20 years — it's both my job and my hobby.

I’ve spent most of my career working in startups, often from scratch — designing systems, building teams, shipping products.  
Along the way, I’ve also been **CTO and co-founder**, leading tech teams, scaling products, and helping raise funding for ambitious projects.  
I love environments where I can have real impact, learn fast, and shape things from the ground up.

Today I focus on **Go**, **TypeScript**, and **React**, and I care deeply about clean code, good architecture, and developer experience.  
I'm also into **retro-gaming**, AI, and regularly follow MOOCs to keep learning.  

Whenever I can, I contribute to open source — it’s my way of giving back 🌍

## ⚙️ What I Do

- 🔧 Build full-stack apps from scratch (frontend + backend)
- ⚙️ Design clean, scalable, and maintainable APIs and backend services
- ⚡ Develop modern, performant, and pixel-perfect frontends (React, Vite, MUI…)
- 🧰 Create tools, scrapers, CLIs, emulator frontends, and developer utilities
- 🧱 Improve legacy codebases and enhance developer experience
- 🕹️ Work on side projects related to games, emulation, and creative tools

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Go, TypeScript, JavaScript — Python (past)
- **Backend**: Go, Node.js, REST, WebSockets, WebRTC
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, MUI
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub/GitLab CI, Linux — more bare-metal than cloud ☁️  
  (capable of setting up Nginx, PostgreSQL, certs, etc. on a raw Debian server)
- **Also into**: Raspberry Pi, 3D Printing, specialized tools

## 🎮 Side Projects

I love building things for fun, learning, or pure curiosity.  
I've created and maintained dozens of side projects over the years — some public, many private.

One of my current favorites is a pure front-end platform built with **React**, **MUI**, and **TypeScript**, which emulates a vintage CRT TV.  
It lets you play NES games directly in the browser using **Mesen** compiled to **WebAssembly**.

I also contribute to [Recalbox](https://www.recalbox.com/), an open-source retro-gaming OS for Raspberry Pi and PC.
